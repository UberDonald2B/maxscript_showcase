## About / Usage
This script quickly exports the currently open Max file bypassing all pop-up dialogs and settings.

During production, having to repeatedly change export settings for each asset export reduces artist efficiency. This utility pre-defines the FBX export settings required to export a model as an FBX model to be imported into Unreal.


## Options
* define the FBX export folder
